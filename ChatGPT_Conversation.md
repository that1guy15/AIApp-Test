# ChatGPT Conversation

**User**: Write a flask application with CRUD APIs for user management. user values include name, email, age and favorite color. Use a MongoDB database and nginx proxy. Build a separate react frontend with a dashboard page listing all current users using the GET API, along with an add user button that opens a form for the POST API. All services must be hosted in a docker app, each with its own container. 

**Assistant**: Here's an outline of how you could structure your application...

<...>

**User**: write a terraform provider that will deploy and run this app to a Kubernetes cluster.

**Assistant**: Here's an example of a Terraform configuration that you could use...

<...>

**User**: write a python setup.py file along with a requirements file for all python dependencies. 

**Assistant**: Here is a basic `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` for your Flask application...

<...>

**User**: what steps are needed to install and setup the react frontend?

**Assistant**: To set up the React frontend, you will need to...

<...>

**User**: show me the directory structure of this project

**Assistant**: Here's an example of how you might structure this project...

<...>

**User**: Instead of using terraform for build and deploy use Github actions. This should build all containers and push them to an existing ECR repo, run all tests in the backend/tests directory, and once all tests pass, push the application to AWS ECR.

**Assistant**: Here's an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Docker images, runs the tests, and pushes the images to ECR...

<...>

**User**: Build unit test for the flask app.py file above

**Assistant**: Here's a basic example of how you might write unit tests for the Flask application...

<...>

**User**: Build unit test for the flask app.py file above using pytest

**Assistant**: Here's an example of how you might write unit tests using pytest...

<...>

**User**: In github actions also include pylint, flake8 testing. Also include black checks that will automatically reformat any python file in the backend directory. 

**Assistant**: To include linting and formatting checks in your GitHub Actions workflow...

<...>

**User**: update the setup.py and requirements.txt files with the required packages

**Assistant**: Here are the updated `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` files...

<...>

**User**: Write React tests for the frontend directory

**Assistant**: Here's how you might write tests for the frontend...

<...>

**User**: where do you place these tests files in the frontend folder?

**Assistant**: In a typical React project, you might place your tests in a `__tests__` directory...

<...>

**User**: Rebuild the React front end to have a simple dashboard with a button linking to a separate UserList page. The userList page should list all existing users and their properties in a table. It should be multi-select with the options to Add, Edit, Delete users. Include a search bar to filter users based on the API get filter parameters.

**Assistant**: Here's how you might structure the updated frontend...

<...>

**User**: Please write new tests for these changes

**Assistant**: Here's how you might write tests for the updated frontend...

<...>

**User**: Build a OpenAI swagger page for all API endpoints in the backend directory. This  page should be automatically updated every time a change is made to an endpoint or a new endpoint is created. use docstrings in each endpoint as needed. This api spec must be as complete as possible.

**Assistant**: To document the API endpoints in a Flask application, you can use the Flask-RESTPlus extension...

<...>

**User**: As a separate container automatically build out usage docks for this application, explaining how to use it. The docs index should be accessible directly from nginx from /docs

**Assistant**: To accomplish this, you could use a tool like MkDocs...

<...>

**User**: In the markdown file above fill out each section with as much detail as possible from what you know about this project in this conversation.

**Assistant**: Sure, here's a more detailed version of the `docs.md` file...

<...>

**User**: return your last response in markdown format

**Assistant**: Sure, here's the updated `docs.md` file...

<...>

**User**: update the main docker-compose file to include the docs container

**Assistant**: Here's how you can modify your `docker-compose.yml` to include the docs container...

<...>

**User**: update the nginx config with the docs endpoint

**Assistant**: To serve the documentation from the `/docs` endpoint, you need to update the Nginx configuration...

<...>

**User**: Write a DEVELOPER.md file that explains the structure of this project, where builds happen, how to make changes and push PRs to GitHub. Include all commands needed and listed above to run this project locally on a Mac or Linux VM. Your response should be in markdown format

**Assistant**: Sure, here's a `DEVELOPER.md` file that covers the project structure, build process, development workflow, and the commands necessary to run the project...

<...>

**User**: Reformat your entire response above into a markdown file

**Assistant**: Sure, here's a `DEVELOPER.md` file in Markdown format...

<...>

**User**: Write a README.md file that explains how

<...>

**User**: Write a .gitignore file for each parent directory in this project

**Assistant**: Here's an example of a `.gitignore` file for each of the directories in your project...
